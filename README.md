# Old Phone Keypad Input Reader

## Overview

This project simulates the functionalty of an old mobile phone keypad, where each number corresponds to a set of characters. 
The program accepts an input string representing key presses on the keypad, with the number of consecutive presses determining the character selected and map these "presses" to compile the output. 

## Examples of inputs:

Pressing 2 once results in 'A'.
Pressing 2 twice results in 'B'.
Pressing 7 four times results in 'S'.

This solution also handles edge cases like backspace (*) and send (#) characters.
